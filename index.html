                        and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are
                        self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)</p>

                        to meet and revolutionise the sense of existence. We, at TEDxBVCOE, intend to suffuse these ideas to each and every cell that builds you, instil your blood with power of innovation so that one can be the change one wants to instigate
                        in the society. We welcome each and every one who would like to be a part of advanced, original and unorthodox talks by the prominent speakers, talks that would surely turn out to trigger the contact between your brain and heart.
